		I am broadly interested in many subfields in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology,
		with a focus on high-redshift quasars and strong gravitational lensing. I am currently 
		trying to solve the following open questions:

		Quasars are very luminous objects in the deep universe.
		They are supermassive black holes in the center of distant galaxies
		that are actively accreting materials, releasing huge amounts of energy.
		I am trying to provide clues to the following open questions:
		(1) how quasars are formed, and
		(2) how quasars influence their host galaxies.
		Currently I am conducting two research projects in this topic:
	</p>
	<p style="color:white">
		(1) Quasar host galaxies at low redshift. Using the high signal-to-noise ratio images and spectra
		in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project, I measure the flux and morphologies 
		of quasar host galaxies by subtracting the quasar contribution in the total flux.
		The properties of quasar host galaxies can reveal the influence of quasars on galaxy evolution.

		(2) Close companions of quasars. I use Hubble Space Telescope images to search for close companions
		around quasars. This helps us to learn how quasars are formed.
