	<!--img src='/mw.jpg' style="float:bottom;width=contain"-->
	<p style="color:white">
		I am broadly interested in many subfields in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology,
		with a focus on high-redshift quasars and strong gravitational lensing. I am currently 
		trying to solve the following open questions:
		<ul>
			<li style="color:white"><p style="color:white"> How do quasars form? 
				How do they impact their host galaxies and their environments, 
				especially at high redshifts? </p></li>
			<li style="color:white"><p style="color:white">How can we utilize gravitational lensing
				to probe faint distant objects and to constrain cosmological parameters?</p></li>
			<li style="color:white"><p style="color:white">How can we find more quasars and other interesting objects
				with upcoming facilities like LSST?</p></li>
		</ul>
	</p>

			Middle: the HST image of a close quasar pair at z=5.66,
			Right: the HST image of a lensing system with two background sources.</figcaption>

		My PhD thesis is a survey for lensed quasars at z>~5, which is the first systematic survey for such objects. 
		I made a mock catalog of lensed quasars to analyze the statistics and observational features of these objects
		<a href="https://github.com/yuemh/lensQSOsim">(check it here!)</a>. The Figure above shows a few of our discoveries.
