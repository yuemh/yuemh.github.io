	<p style="color:white">
		I am broadly interested in many subfields in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology,
		with a focus on high-redshift quasars and strong gravitational lensing. I am currently 
		trying to solve the following open questions:
		<ul>
			<li style="color:white">How do quasars form? 
				How do they impact their host galaxies and their environments, 
				especially at high redshifts? </li>
			<li style="color:white">How can we utilize gravitational lensing
				to probe faint distant objects?</li>
			<li style="color:white">How can we find more quasars and other interesting objects
				with upcoming facilities like LSST?</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

		A few projects that I am working on:
	</p>

	<p style="color:white">
		- A survey of high-redshift gravitationally lensed quasars. 
		I am leading a survey for lensed quasars at z>~5, which is the first systematic survey for such objects. 
		I made a mock catalog of lensed quasars to analyze the statistics and observational features of these objects
		<a href="https://github.com/yuemh/lensQSOsim">(check it here!)</a>. The Figure above shows a few of our discoveries.
	</p>

	<p style="color:white">
		- High-resolution imaging of z~7 quasar host galaxies. As a Co-I of a few JWST programs targeting at z>~7 quasars,
		I will analyze the high-resolution images of these quasars and measure their host galaxy properties. 
		For many of these quasars, we will also get their high-resolution ALMA image and explore the sub-kpc structures in their host galaxies.
